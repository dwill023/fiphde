First, load the `fiphde` package and other ancillary packages.

```{r, message = FALSE, warning = FALSE}
library(fiphde)
library(dplyr)
library(purrr)
library(readr)
library(ggplot2)
library(furrr)
```

# Get data

First, let's retrieve Influenza-like Illness (ILI) data from [CDC FluView](https://gis.cdc.gov/grasp/fluview/fluportaldashboard.html). Note that `years` argument gets the *flu season* corresponding to the year. If you only get 2020-2021, you're getting the 2020-2021 and 2021-2022 flu season, meaning that you will *NOT* capture early 2020 data.

```{r}

```
