Forecasting Influenza in Support of Public Health Decision Making

## Installation

You can install the development version of fiphde from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("signaturescience/fiphde")
```

You will need a GitHub personal access token to do so. First, create a new token at <https://github.com/settings/tokens> after logging in. Copy this token. Next, in your `~/.Renviron` file, add the following line:

```
GITHUB_PAT="paste-in-your-github-pat-from-step-1-here"
```

The `devtools::install_github()` function automatically tries to retrieve your token through the `devtools::github_pat()` function, which defaults to looking at the `GITHUB_PAT` environment variable.

Alternatively, you may directly supply your token in the install command:

``` r
devtools::install_github("signaturescience/fiphde", auth_token="paste-your-token-here")
```
